					<li> Works only on PHP 5 version.</li>
					<li> To use this module you first must register on http://smscoin.net website,
            and connection to sms:key service.</li>

 					<li> Registration and connection process are absolutely free.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<h3>How it works:</h3>
				<br />
			This plugin can provide paid access to any content on your website. <br />
			In reply SMS-message user receives a short text password (key), <br />
			which allows him to access the content you hide with this key. <br /> 
			You decide how many times or for how long this password can be used for access. <br />
			<br /> 
			In the text of a page or post you add the tag: [rkey] hidden text [/ rkey]. <br /> 
			To view the text hidden between the tags, user will need to send an SMS to a short <br /> 
			code according to the country of his choice. In reply SMS message he will receive the access code that allows him to access the hidden text.<br />
				<br />
				Example:
				<br />
				<img src = "pic/en/key_page.png"/>
				<br />
				<p> We advice you not to use the module several times on the same page. </p>
